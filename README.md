### How to include it in my project?

**Linux:**

Run this command in your terminal:
>g++ <cpp_files> -L<path> -lstringclass -o main.out

Take note that <cpp_files> and <path> are denoted as variable, <cpp_files>: is where you can put your .cpp files on it, while <path> is the path of the .so library. For example: g++ main.cpp -L~/Downloads -lstringclass -o main.out
